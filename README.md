iQuiz: A Multiple-Choice Q-and-A application
users can choose from a collection of quizzes
each quiz has a number (1-to-many) of questions
each question is a multiple-choice answer
users progress through each question one at a time
app will track their answers
app could upload their scores
quizzes are updated from a server

Part 1: Basic interaction
we need a TableView for the quizzes
each element will lead the user to a list of questions
so we start with the TableView filled with subjects
use Mathematics, Marvel Super Heroes, and Science
for now, use an in-memory array
make sure to build this as a UITableViewSource

Part 1: TableView cells
icon on the left (any image works)
subject: title (30 characters)
description: short sentence

Part 1: ToolBar across the top
put a button on the Toolbar, title it "Settings"
"Settings" should (for now) pop a UIAlertController
have it read "Settings go here"/"OK"
